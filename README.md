# InteractiveSpirograph
My attempt to write an interactive spirograph drawing app with help from ChatGPT-3. 
Or more precisely, ChatGPT-3 is writing it, I'm just telling it what I want.

So far it's been a great experience. I'm not a skilled coder by any means but I know enough to try to work with something like chatGPT-3 (Or just GPT3 from now on).

The idea is to use a main.py for the main_loop and to divide the different elements in classes to be able to expand the code later on.
So far I have a spirograph class in spirograph.py and a controlpanel class. Every class will have it's own file. 

I will post my complete ChatGPT-3 transcript in a seperate textfile with the date etc in there.

ChatGPT-3 is great but not very reliable yet due to overwhelming use. That's why I publish this on Git just in case someone far better at coding than me, or maybe around the same level, just anyone who is bored and stumbles into my little project who thinks he can help me would be greatly appreciated! Even if you just want to fork it and mess with it on your own is all fine with me, all I ask is if you get somewhere with it, please share it back to me if I haven't gotten to that point myself yet. I would be more than happy to attribute full credits to people for what they do. Just don't expect a lot of people to see it Im afraid
